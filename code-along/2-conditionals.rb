# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 2-conditionals.rb

# Conditionals are decisions that you are asking the computer to make
# If certain conditions are met a decision is made based on the code and we are given an output

# A double equal sign "==" is a judgement
# A single equal sign "=" is an assignment in the computer's memory

# Booleans
# if 1 + 1 == 2
#     puts "This is true"
# end

# if 1 + 1 == 3
#     puts "You should never see this"
# end

# Example

# # Input
# user_entered_password = "kale"
# real_password = "tacos"

# # Algorithm
# if user_entered_password == real_password
#     # Output
#     puts "You're in."
# else 
#     puts "Sorry, wrong password."
# end

# =================================================

# Boolean Expressions

# If Conditional Logic

# If/Else Conditional Logic

# Elsif Conditional Logic

# Input
# my_team_score = 4
# opponent_team_score = 5

# if my_team_score > opponent_team_score
#     puts "We win!"
# elsif my_team_score == opponent_team_score
#     puts "We tied!"
# else
#     puts "We lost!"
# end

# ======================================

# Combining Expressions
# Use syntax &&

#Input
temperature = 31
precip = 60

#Algorithm
# if temperature > 60 && precip == 0
#     puts "It's nice outside!"
# elsif temperature < 60 && precip < 50
#     puts "It is cold but there should not be precipitation"
# else
#     puts "It's bad weather out there!"
# end
