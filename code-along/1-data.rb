# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers

# Non-numbers

# True, False

# Nothing

# Variables

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation

# # Put the number 2 on screen

# puts 2

# # Put the number 5 on screen

# puts 5

# # Put our favorite food on screen

# puts "tacos"

# True and False values

# puts true
# puts false

# Nothing

# puts nil

# Store the number 5 in memory
# x = 5

# Store the number 2 in memory
# y = 2

# Multiply the two numbers and show them on screen
# puts x * y

# Store the number of tacos
# number_of_tacos = 5

# # Store my favorite food in memory
# favorite_food = "Tacos"

# # Write my food order to the screen (called concatonate line 51 and 54 together)
# # This output with lines 51-52 and 54-55 will display "5 Tacos"
# puts "#{number_of_tacos} #{favorite_food}"

# # Fun things
# # puts code.upcase makes all the output text ALL CAPS
# # puts code.reverse makes all the output in reverse order
